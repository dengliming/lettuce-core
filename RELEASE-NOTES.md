Lettuce 6.1 M1 RELEASE NOTES
==============================

The Lettuce team is delighted to announce the availability of the first Lettuce 6.1 milestone.

This is a massive release thanks to all the community contributions. Most notable changes that ship with this release are:

* Support for most Redis 6.2 commands and command changes
* Micrometer integration
* `CommandListeners` API to intercept Redis commands
* extended Keep-Alive options
* Coroutine variant of `ScanStream`
* TCP NoDelay enabled by default
* Experimental support for io_uring

Lettuce 6 supports Redis 2.6+ up to Redis 6.x. In terms of Java runtime, Lettuce requires at least Java 8 and works with Java 16.

Thanks to all contributors who made Lettuce 6.1.0.M1 possible.

Micrometer Integration
----------------------

Lettuce ships an integration for Micrometer. Commands are tracked by using two Micrometer Times: `lettuce.command.firstresponse` and `lettuce.command.completion`. The following tags are attached to each timer:

* `command`: Name of the command (`GET`, `SET`, …)
* `local`: Local socket (localhost/127.0.0.1:45243 or ANY when local distinction is disabled, which is the default behavior)
* `remote`: Remote socket (localhost/127.0.0.1:6379)

To enable Micrometer, create  `MicrometerCommandLatencyRecorder` from `MeterRegistry` and register it in `ClientResources`:

```java
MeterRegistry meterRegistry = …;
MicrometerOptions options = MicrometerOptions.create();
ClientResources resources = ClientResources.builder().commandLatencyRecorder(new MicrometerCommandLatencyRecorder(meterRegistry, options)).build();

RedisClient client = RedisClient.create(resources);
```

Make sure to have Micrometer on your class path (example from a Maven `pom.xml`):


```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.micrometer</groupId>
    <artifactId>micrometer-core</artifactId>
    <version>${micrometer.version}</version> <!-- e.g. micrometer.version==1.6.0 -->
</dependency>
```

CommandListeners
----------------

Command listeners allow intercepting Redis Command calls before the command is sent and upon completion (success/failure). A `CommandListener` can be registered with `RedisClient` and `RedisClusterClient`:

```java
RedisClient client = …;

client.addListener(new CommandListener() {
    @Override
    public void commandStarted(CommandStartedEvent event) {
        Map<String, Object> context = event.getContext();
        context.put(…);
    }

    @Override
    public void commandSucceeded(CommandSucceededEvent event) {
        Map<String, Object> context = event.getContext();
    }

    @Override
    public void commandFailed(CommandFailedEvent event) {
        CommandListener.super.commandFailed(event);
    }
});


StatefulRedisConnection<String, String> connection = client.connect();
```
Command events allow attaching contextual details that can be accessed upon completion.

Experimental support for io_uring
---------------------------------

We've adopted Netty's experimental io_uring support for Linux-based systems to allow participating in improved I/O performance.

io_uring will be enabled automatically if you're running on Linux and you have the dependency on your classpath:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.netty.incubator</groupId>
    <artifactId>netty-incubator-transport-native-io_uring</artifactId>
    <version>${netty.transport-native-io_uring.version}</version>
    <classifier>linux-x86_64</classifier>
</dependency>
```

When having both native transports enabled (io_uring and epoll), then io_uring has precedence over epoll.
We'd love to hear from you how io_uring works out for you.
